## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Review Your Current Status
```bash
cd /Users/fab/GitHub/proximity
./epic0_quick_start.sh progress
```

This will show you:
- Total backend tests (259)
- Total E2E tests (~120)
- Quick action menu

### Step 2: Run Your First Test Check
```bash
# Check backend tests
./epic0_quick_start.sh backend

# This will:
# - Run all 259 backend tests
# - Show pass/fail count
# - Highlight any failures
```

### Step 3: Generate Your Baseline Report
```bash
./epic0_quick_start.sh report
```

This creates a dated report showing your starting point.

### Step 4: Review the Master Plan
```bash
# Open in your editor
code EPIC_0_MASTER_PLAN.md

# Or read in terminal
less EPIC_0_MASTER_PLAN.md
```

## 🎯 Your First Day Action Plan

### Morning (2 hours)

**9:00 - 9:30: Setup & Baseline**
```bash
# 1. Review overall status
./epic0_quick_start.sh progress

# 2. Generate baseline report
./epic0_quick_start.sh report

# 3. Open baseline report
ls -lt EPIC_0_STATUS_REPORT_*.md | head -1
# Copy the filename and open it
```

**9:30 - 10:30: Understand Current State**
```bash
# 1. Run backend tests to see failures
cd tests
pytest -v --tb=short > current_status.txt 2>&1

# 2. Review failures
less current_status.txt

# 3. Count failures
grep "FAILED" current_status.txt | wc -l

# 4. Focus area: Clone/Config tests
pytest test_app_clone_config.py -v --tb=short
```

**10:30 - 11:00: Plan Your Attack**
```bash
# 1. Read PILLAR 1 in master plan
code EPIC_0_MASTER_PLAN.md
# Jump to "PILLAR 1: Backend Test Perfection"

# 2. Review Task 1.1: Fix Clone/Config Tests
# Note down the specific test failures

# 3. Create your daily task list
```

### Afternoon (3 hours)

**13:00 - 15:00: Fix First Test**
```bash
# 1. Pick the first failing test in test_app_clone_config.py
# Example: test_clone_app_success

# 2. Run it in isolation
cd tests
pytest test_app_clone_config.py::TestCloneApp::test_clone_app_success -v -s

# 3. Read the error carefully
# 4. Check the code in backend/services/app_service.py
# 5. Fix the issue (see MASTER_PLAN.md for common fixes)
# 6. Re-run the test
# 7. Commit if passing
```

**15:00 - 16:00: Verify and Document**
```bash
# 1. Run all clone tests
pytest test_app_clone_config.py -v

# 2. If all pass, run full backend suite
pytest -v --tb=short

# 3. Document what you fixed
echo "## Day 1 Progress

Fixed Tests:
- test_clone_app_success ✅

Changes Made:
- [Describe the fix]

Remaining Work:
- [List remaining failures]
" >> DAILY_LOG.md

# 4. Commit your work

## 🆘 Getting Unstuck

### If Backend Tests Won't Pass:
1. Read error message CAREFULLY
2. Check EPIC_0_MASTER_PLAN.md "Troubleshooting Quick Fixes"
3. Run test in isolation with `-s` flag for prints
4. Check if it's an AsyncMock issue (most common)
5. Review the fixture definitions in conftest.py
6. Check similar passing tests for patterns

### If E2E Tests Are Flaky:
1. Check if authenticated_page fixture is being used
2. Add more waits (page.wait_for_timeout)
3. Verify page.is_closed() before actions
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Run test 10 times to identify pattern
6. Review recent E2E_TEST_STABILIZATION_REPORT.md

### If You're Overwhelmed:
1. Take a break! ☕
2. Focus on ONE test at a time
3. Use ./epic0_quick_start.sh to automate
4. Review Quick Reference for commands
5. Remember: This is a marathon, not a sprint
6. Celebrate small wins

## 💬 Philosophy

> **"Stability First, Features Second"**

EPIC 0 is not about adding features. It's about building an unshakeable foundation that enables infinite innovation later.

Every test you fix is a brick in that foundation.  
Every warning you eliminate is reinforced steel.  
Every flaky test you stabilize is quality concrete.

**You're not just fixing tests. You're building confidence.**

When EPIC 0 is done, you'll be able to say with absolute certainty:
- "Our backend is rock solid"
- "Our E2E tests are reliable"
- "We've covered all critical flows"
- "We've validated against real infrastructure"

And THAT confidence is worth more than any feature.
