/**
 * Authentication Store - Atomic State Management (Refactored)
 *
 * Key Principles:
 * - ATOMIC STATE: User state is updated in a single synchronous operation.
 * - DERIVED AUTHENTICATION: isAuthenticated is computed from user state, not stored separately.
 * - NO RACE CONDITIONS: Authentication status is always consistent with user data.
 * - HttpOnly cookies are the source of truth for the session.
 * - The store hydrates itself by calling a 'user' endpoint on startup.
