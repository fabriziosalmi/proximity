PROXIMITY BACKEND COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY & QUALITY AUDIT
================================================================================

AUDIT DATE: 2025-10-29
SCOPE: Critical backend API endpoints, models, tasks, and services
FRAMEWORK: Django Ninja, Celery, Proxmox API

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Total Issues Found: 31
- CRITICAL: 5 issues
- HIGH: 8 issues
- MEDIUM: 13 issues
- LOW/INFO: 5 issues

Risk Level: HIGH
This codebase has multiple critical security and reliability issues that require
immediate attention before production deployment.

================================================================================
CRITICAL ISSUES (MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY)
================================================================================

1. MISSING AUTHORIZATION ON APPLICATION ENDPOINTS
   - Missing owner check on: get_application, app_action, clone_application, logs
   - Impact: Any authenticated user can view, control, or delete ANY application
   - Severity: CRITICAL - Authorization Bypass
   - Files: applications/api.py lines 365-494

2. UNENCRYPTED PASSWORD STORAGE
   - Proxmox API credentials stored in plaintext in database
   - Root passwords for containers stored in plaintext
   - Impact: Database breach = Full infrastructure compromise
   - Severity: CRITICAL - Credential Exposure
   - Files: proxmox/models.py, applications/tasks.py

3. MISSING ADMIN PERMISSION CHECK
   - Catalog reload endpoint accessible to any authenticated user
   - Impact: DOS, service disruption, resource exhaustion
   - Severity: CRITICAL - Missing Access Control
   - Files: catalog/api.py line 97

================================================================================
HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (THIS SPRINT)
================================================================================

4. RACE CONDITIONS IN CRITICAL OPERATIONS
   - Hostname uniqueness check-then-create race condition
   - VMID allocation race condition in parallel deployments
   - Impact: Duplicate resources, data corruption
   - Severity: HIGH - Concurrency Issues
   - Files: applications/api.py line 128, applications/tasks.py line 154

5. RESOURCE LEAKS ON FAILURE
   - Allocated ports not released on deployment failure
   - Orphaned snapshots on clone failure
   - Impact: Resource exhaustion
   - Severity: HIGH - Resource Management
   - Files: applications/api.py line 211, proxmox/services.py line 518

6. UNRELIABLE ERROR RECOVERY
   - Task retry logic has unbounded exponential backoff
   - Silent failures in config capture during adoption
   - Status set to error before retrying
   - Impact: Tasks stuck in retry loops or failing silently
   - Severity: HIGH - Async Task Issues
   - Files: applications/tasks.py lines 345, 1018

================================================================================
AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION GAPS
================================================================================

Missing authorization checks on:
- GET /{app_id} - View any application
- POST /{app_id}/action - Control any application (start/stop/delete)
- POST /{app_id}/clone - Clone any application
- GET /{app_id}/logs - View deployment logs
- POST /catalog/reload - Reload catalog (admin only)
- DELETE /hosts/{host_id} - Delete proxmox host
- POST /hosts - Create proxmox host
- PUT /hosts/{host_id} - Update proxmox host

Total: 8 endpoints missing authorization checks

Files: 
- applications/api.py
- catalog/api.py
- proxmox/api.py
- backups/api.py

================================================================================
SECURITY VULNERABILITIES
================================================================================

1. PLAINTEXT CREDENTIAL STORAGE
   - Proxmox API passwords stored without encryption
   - LXC root passwords stored without encryption
   - Cost: Full infrastructure compromise if database leaked

2. CREDENTIALS IN LOGS
   - Passwords may be logged in deployment logs
   - Cost: Credentials exposed in log files

3. ERROR MESSAGE INFORMATION DISCLOSURE
   - Raw exception messages returned to API clients
   - Cost: System internals revealed to attackers

4. MISSING INPUT VALIDATION
   - Hostname format validation missing
   - Port range validation missing
   - Network CIDR validation incomplete
   - Cost: Invalid configurations, potential DOS

================================================================================
CONCURRENCY & RACE CONDITIONS
================================================================================

1. HOSTNAME UNIQUENESS RACE CONDITION
   - exists() check followed by create() without transaction
   - Window: Multiple lines of code where duplicate could occur
   - Probability: High under concurrent load
   - Impact: Duplicate hostnames in database

2. VMID ALLOCATION RACE CONDITION
   - Database check followed by assignment without atomic transaction
   - Window: Multiple lines of code
   - Impact: Two apps assigned same VMID

3. BACKUP STATUS INCONSISTENCY
   - Multiple model saves without select_for_update locking
   - Impact: Race conditions during concurrent backup operations

================================================================================
DATABASE & ORM ISSUES
================================================================================

1. N+1 QUERY PROBLEM
   - List endpoint doesn't use select_related('host')
   - 20 apps = 21 database queries instead of 1
   - Impact: Poor performance, database load

2. MISSING INDEXES
   - No consideration of query patterns
   - Impact: Slow queries on large datasets

3. MISSING CONSTRAINTS
   - Hostname uniqueness not enforced at database level
   - VMID uniqueness handled in application code only
   - Impact: Race conditions possible

================================================================================
INPUT VALIDATION GAPS
================================================================================

Missing validation on:
1. Hostname format (RFC 1123)
2. Port numbers (1-65535 range)
3. CIDR/IP addresses (gateway must be in subnet)
4. Page/per_page parameters (could be 0 or huge)
5. Limit parameter (could be 0 or cause DOS)
6. API responses (not validated that they're expected type)

Impact: Invalid configurations, DOS, crashes

================================================================================
ERROR HANDLING ISSUES
================================================================================

1. BARE EXCEPT CLAUSES
   - Catches SystemExit, KeyboardInterrupt
   - Masks serious errors

2. SILENT FAILURES
   - Config capture failures logged but silently ignored
   - Backup status updates don't fail appropriately

3. INCONSISTENT ERROR RESPONSES
   - Mix of HttpError() and return (status, dict)
   - Clients must handle multiple formats

4. LEAKED EXCEPTION DETAILS
   - Raw exception messages in API responses
   - Reveals system internals to attackers

================================================================================
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

1. PORT LEAKS
   - No cleanup on deployment failure
   - Depletes available port pool

2. SNAPSHOT LEAKS
   - Failed cleanup leaves orphaned snapshots
   - Consumes disk space

3. DATABASE CONNECTIONS
   - No connection pooling configured
   - SSH connections may timeout without cleanup

4. TASK QUEUE
   - Failure to queue task not handled
   - Allocated resources not released

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED FIX PRIORITY
================================================================================

1. Add authorization checks to all user-owned resources
2. Implement password encryption (ProxmoxHost + LXC credentials)
3. Add admin permission check to catalog reload
4. Fix race conditions with database transactions
5. Implement proper error handling and retry logic

PHASE 2 - HIGH (Next sprint)
6. Add comprehensive input validation
7. Fix resource leaks (ports, snapshots)
8. Add select_related to N+1 queries
9. Remove exception details from API responses
10. Implement proper timeout handling

PHASE 3 - MEDIUM (Following sprint)
11. Add database-level constraints
12. Improve error response consistency
13. Add monitoring and alerting
14. Performance optimization
15. Code cleanup and refactoring

================================================================================
