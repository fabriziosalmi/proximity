## Critical Issues At A Glance

### 1. Missing Authorization (4 CRITICAL)
- Any authenticated user can view ANY application
- Any authenticated user can control ANY application (start/stop/delete)
- Any authenticated user can clone ANY application
- Any authenticated user can view ANY deployment logs

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to all tenant resources

**Files:**
- `apps/applications/api.py` lines 365-494
- `apps/backups/api.py` lines 42-313

### 2. Unencrypted Password Storage (2 CRITICAL)
- Proxmox API credentials stored in plaintext
- LXC root passwords stored in plaintext

**Impact:** Complete infrastructure compromise if database breached

**Files:**
- `apps/proxmox/models.py` line 38-41
- `apps/applications/tasks.py` line 319

### 3. Missing Admin Permission Check (1 CRITICAL)
- Catalog reload endpoint accessible to any user
- Could cause DOS or service disruption

**Impact:** Administrative function exposed to all users

**Files:**
- `apps/catalog/api.py` lines 97-113

---

## High Priority Issues At A Glance

### 1. Race Conditions (2 HIGH)
- Hostname uniqueness check-then-create without transaction
- VMID allocation without proper locking

**Impact:** Duplicate resources in database

**Files:**
- `apps/applications/api.py` line 128
- `apps/applications/tasks.py` line 154

### 2. Resource Leaks (2 HIGH)
- Ports not released on deployment failure
- Snapshots not cleaned up on clone failure

**Impact:** Resource exhaustion

**Files:**
- `apps/applications/api.py` line 211
- `apps/proxmox/services.py` line 518

### 3. Unreliable Error Recovery (2 HIGH)
- Task retry logic issues with exponential backoff
- Silent failures during adoption

**Impact:** Tasks fail silently or retry indefinitely

**Files:**
- `apps/applications/tasks.py` lines 345, 1018

### 4. Missing Null Check (2 HIGH)
- Unvalidated request.auth in backup operations
- Missing null check on metrics calculation

---

## Fix Priority Timeline

### PHASE 1 - CRITICAL (Before Deployment)
**Time: 1-2 weeks**
1. Add authorization to all user-owned resource endpoints
2. Implement password encryption for credentials
3. Add admin permission check to catalog reload
4. Fix race conditions with transactions and locking
5. Implement proper task retry logic

### PHASE 2 - HIGH (Next Sprint)
**Time: 2-3 weeks**
6. Add comprehensive input validation
7. Fix resource leaks (ports, snapshots)
8. Optimize queries (N+1 fix)
9. Secure error messages
10. Timeout handling

### PHASE 3 - MEDIUM (Following Sprint)
**Time: 2-3 weeks**
11. Database constraints
12. Error response consistency
13. Monitoring and alerting
14. Performance optimization
15. Code cleanup

## Testing Verification

After implementing fixes, verify with:

### Security Testing
- [ ] Authorization checks on all endpoints
- [ ] Password encryption in database
- [ ] No credentials in logs
- [ ] Input validation on boundaries

### Concurrency Testing
- [ ] Parallel hostname creation fails appropriately
- [ ] Parallel VMID allocation doesn't duplicate
- [ ] Load test with 100+ concurrent operations
- [ ] No race conditions detected

### Error Handling Testing
- [ ] Port cleanup on failure verified
- [ ] Task retries succeed after transient failures
- [ ] Snapshot cleanup on clone failure
- [ ] Exception details not leaked to clients

### Resource Leak Testing
- [ ] Port pool not exhausted after failures
- [ ] Snapshots cleaned up properly
- [ ] Database connections returned to pool
- [ ] Memory usage stable under load

## Escalation Criteria

**CRITICAL Issues (Do not deploy without fixing):**
- Authorization checks
- Password encryption
- Race conditions

**HIGH Issues (Fix before production use):**
- Resource leaks
- Error handling
- Admin permission checks

**MEDIUM Issues (Fix in first sprint after launch):**
- Input validation
- Query optimization
- Error response security
