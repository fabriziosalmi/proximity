## TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Completed Fixes

1. **Authorization Tests**
   ```
   - Test non-owner cannot view app ✓
   - Test non-owner cannot control app ✓
   - Test non-admin cannot reload catalog ✓
   - Test non-owner cannot view logs ✓
   ```

2. **Encryption Tests**
   ```
   - Verify passwords encrypted in DB
   - Verify decryption works correctly
   - Test backward compatibility with plaintext
   ```

3. **Concurrency Tests**
   ```
   - Test duplicate hostname creation
   - Test concurrent VMID allocation
   - Test 100+ concurrent deployments
   ```

4. **Validation Tests**
   ```
   - Test hostname format rejection
   - Test invalid port rejection
   - Test invalid VMID rejection
   ```
