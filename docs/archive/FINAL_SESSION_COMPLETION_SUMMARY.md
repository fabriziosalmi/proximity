## 💡 **IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS**

### Atomic VMID Allocation
```python
with transaction.atomic():
    app_locked = Application.objects.select_for_update().get(id=app_id)
    # Allocate VMID atomically
    # Prevents race conditions on concurrent deployments
```

### Consistent Error Responses
```python
# All endpoints now use:
raise HttpError(status_code, "error message")
# Returns: {"detail": "error message"}
```

### Bounded Task Retry
```python
# Exponential backoff capped at 15 minutes
retry_countdown = min(60 * (2 ** attempt), 900)
```

### CIDR Validation
```python
from ipaddress import ip_network
validate_cidr("10.0.0.0/24")  # Valid
validate_cidr("999.999.999.999/24")  # Raises ValueError
```

## 🎓 **LESSONS LEARNED**

1. **Race Conditions**: Database constraints and row locks are essential
2. **Error Handling**: Be specific with exception types, log with context
3. **Validation**: All external input must be validated at API layer
4. **Performance**: N+1 queries are often hidden until measured
5. **Async Tasks**: Retry logic must be carefully designed
6. **Consistency**: Standardizing error responses improves client experience
