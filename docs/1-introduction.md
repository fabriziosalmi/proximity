# 1. Introduction to Proximity

## Welcome to Your Personal Cloud's Command Deck

Proximity is more than just another container management tool. It's an **open-source, immersive management layer** for your personal cloud infrastructure, starting with Proxmox VE. It is engineered from the ground up to transform server management from a chore into a delightful, intuitive, and even fun experience.

Our goal is to provide the missing layer between Proxmox VE's powerful but complex infrastructure and the applications you want to run, rivaling the simplicity of platforms like Heroku while maintaining the control and privacy of self-hosting.

## The Vision: Our Four Pillars

1.  **"Casa Digitale" (Digital Homestead):** We are building a virtual data center, not a web form. The "All-is-Rack" design paradigm is central to our skeuomorphic "Command Deck" UI, creating an immersive and tactile environment.

2.  **"Divertimento" (Fun):** We believe in creating an emotional connection with our tools. Proximity features a "gamified" user experience with satisfying interactions, animations, and audio feedback that make managing your servers enjoyable.

3.  **"Tranquillit√† by Default" (Peace of Mind):** Proximity is designed to be proactively stable and secure. Features like the self-healing backend, zero-downtime operations, and safety-first design for destructive actions mean you can manage your infrastructure with confidence.

4.  **"Ecosistema Aperto" (Open Ecosystem):** The architecture is designed for extensibility. We envision a future where themes, widgets, and custom application catalogs can be contributed and shared by the community.

## Who is Proximity For?

*   **üè† Home Lab Enthusiasts:** Run your personal applications (Nextcloud, Plex, Home Assistant) without wrestling with Docker Compose files and reverse proxies.
*   **üöÄ Developers:** Quickly spin up development environments, test stacks, and demo applications without infrastructure overhead.
*   **üè¢ Small Teams:** Self-host team tools (GitLab, Mattermost) with professional-grade deployment and backup workflows.
*   **üéì Learners:** Explore containerization, networking, and infrastructure concepts through an intuitive, hands-on interface.
