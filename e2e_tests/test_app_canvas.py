"""
E2E Tests for In-App Canvas Feature.

Tests the in-app canvas modal functionality including:
- Opening apps in canvas modal
- Canvas iframe loading and display
- Canvas controls (refresh, open in new tab, close)
- Error handling for apps without iframe support
- Modal interaction (escape key, click outside)

This test suite validates the new In-App Canvas feature that allows
users to view and interact with applications directly within the Proximity UI.
