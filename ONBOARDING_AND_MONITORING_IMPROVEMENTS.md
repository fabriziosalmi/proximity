# First Run Onboarding & Monitoring UI Improvements

## Summary

This document outlines the implementation of two major features:
1. **First Run Onboarding Experience** - A "Power On" animation for new installations
2. **Monitoring Page UI Improvements** - Better alignment and styling of rack-styled containers

---

## 1. First Run Onboarding Feature

### Overview
Added a sophisticated "Power On" screen that appears only on the first run (when no users exist in the database). This provides a polished initialization experience before users see the registration screen.

### Implementation Details

#### Backend Changes

**File: `/backend/api/endpoints/system.py`**
- Added new endpoint: `GET /api/v1/system/status/initial`
- Returns `{"is_first_run": true}` if no users exist in database
- Returns `{"is_first_run": false}` if users exist
- Imports: Added `get_db` and `User` model

**File: `/backend/main.py`**
- Created public system router for unauthenticated access
- Made `/health` and `/status/initial` endpoints publicly accessible
- Added imports: `Depends`, `APIRouter`
- Public endpoints don't require authentication token

#### Frontend Changes

**File: `/backend/frontend/index.html`**
- Added Power On screen HTML structure immediately after `<body>` tag
- Hidden by default with `style="display: none;"`
- Includes power button with SVG icon and initialization text
- Updated cache-busting versions to v20251009-51

**File: `/backend/frontend/css/styles.css`**
- Added complete styling section for Power On screen
- Includes:
  - Full-screen overlay with gradient background
  - Animated power button with glowing effects
  - Hover states with visual feedback
  - Pulse animation on activation
  - Fade-out boot sequence
  - Accessibility support (focus styles, reduced motion)
  - Responsive design

**File: `/backend/frontend/js/onboarding.js`** (NEW)
- Self-contained module handling entire onboarding flow
- Exports `handleOnboarding()` function returning a Promise
- Checks first-run status via API
- If first run: displays Power On screen and waits for user interaction
- If not first run: resolves immediately
- Includes sound integration (plays deploy_start sound)
- Keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space to activate)
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

**File: `/backend/frontend/js/main.js`**
- Imported `handleOnboarding` from onboarding.js
- Created `initializeProximity()` wrapper function
- Calls `await handleOnboarding()` before normal app initialization
- Minimal integration - only 2 lines of modification to existing flow

**File: `/backend/frontend/app.js`**
- Disabled automatic `DOMContentLoaded` initialization
- Exposed `init()` function globally for main.js to call
- Added comment explaining the new flow

### User Flow

1. **First Run (No Users)**:
   - Page loads → Power On screen appears
   - User clicks power button → Animation plays
   - Screen fades out → Registration modal appears
   
2. **Subsequent Runs (Users Exist)**:
   - Page loads → Onboarding check passes instantly
   - Login modal or dashboard appears immediately
   - No Power On screen shown

### Key Design Principles

✅ **Isolation**: Onboarding module is completely self-contained  
✅ **Non-Breaking**: Existing auth flows remain untouched  
✅ **Promise-Based**: Proper async sequencing with await  
✅ **Accessibility**: Keyboard support and reduced motion  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks on API errors

## 2. Monitoring Page UI Improvements

### Overview
Improved the alignment and styling of labels and values in the monitoring page's rack-styled containers to display them on the same line with professional spacing.

### Changes Made

**File: `/backend/frontend/css/styles.css`**

#### Main Improvements

1. **`.stat-info` Container** (Line ~778)
   - Changed `flex-direction` from `column` to `row`
   - Added `align-items: center` for vertical centering
   - Added `justify-content: space-between` for label-value spacing
   - Increased gap to `1rem` for consistent spacing

2. **`.stat-info .stat-label`** (Line ~784)
   - Adjusted padding to `0.4rem 0.85rem` for better alignment
   - Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent label compression
   - Added `min-width: fit-content` to keep labels readable
   - Maintained dark background with glowing text effect

3. **`.stat-info .stat-value`** (Line ~813)
   - Adjusted padding to `0.4rem 1rem` to match label height
   - Changed `line-height` to `1.2` for better vertical centering
   - Increased `min-width` to `70px` for better appearance
   - Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent value compression

4. **`.stat-item` Container** (Line ~703)
   - Increased gap to `1.25rem` for better visual spacing
   - Added `padding: 0.25rem 0` for subtle vertical balance

5. **Mobile Responsiveness** (Line ~937+)
   - Added specific mobile styles for screens under 640px
   - Reduced font sizes slightly for mobile
   - Adjusted gaps and padding for smaller screens
   - Ensured labels and values stay aligned on mobile

### Visual Result

**Before:**
```
[LED] Label
      Value
```

**After:**
```
[LED] Label ..................... Value
```

The rack-styled container now displays:
- LED indicator on the left
- Label and value on the same horizontal line
- Proper spacing between elements
- Professional alignment across all screen sizes
- Consistent visual hierarchy

### Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop (>1024px)**: Full horizontal layout with optimal spacing
- **Tablet (640-1024px)**: Items wrap to 2 columns, alignment maintained
- **Mobile (<640px)**: Single column, slightly reduced fonts, alignment preserved

- [ ] Sound plays on activation (if enabled)
- [ ] Screen fades out after animation
- [ ] Registration modal appears after Power On
- [ ] After registration, Power On doesn't show on reload
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (Tab + Enter/Space)
- [ ] Works with reduced motion preference

### Monitoring Page
- [ ] Labels and values align on same line
- [ ] Proper spacing between LED, label, and value
- [ ] Responsive layout works on mobile devices
- [ ] Text remains readable at all screen sizes
- [ ] Visual hierarchy is clear and professional

## Rollback Instructions

If issues occur, revert changes in this order:

1. Remove onboarding call from `main.js` (restore original)
2. Re-enable `DOMContentLoaded` listener in `app.js`
3. Remove Power On HTML from `index.html`
4. Remove `/status/initial` endpoint from `system.py`
5. Remove public router from `main.py`
6. Delete `/js/onboarding.js`
7. Revert `.stat-info` CSS changes (flex-direction: column)
