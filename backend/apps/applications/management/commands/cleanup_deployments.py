Django Management Command: cleanup_deployments

This command completely purges all application-related data from the database,
including Applications, DeploymentLogs, and Backups. It's designed for testing
and development scenarios where you need a clean slate.

Usage:
    # Interactive mode (with confirmation prompt)
    python manage.py cleanup_deployments
    
    # Automated mode (no confirmation, for scripts)
    python manage.py cleanup_deployments --no-input
    
    # Docker usage
    docker-compose exec backend python manage.py cleanup_deployments --no-input
